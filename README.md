#DESCRIPTION: 
CODTECH C LANGUAGE INTERNSHIP TASKS â€“ PROJECT DESCRIPTION This repository contains the completed solution for all four internship tasks assigned by CODTECH as part of the C Programming Language internship. The internship primarily focused on practical implementation of core C programming concepts, including file handling, data structures, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques. Each task was carefully designed to enhance hands-on coding skills and provide real-world problem-solving experience in the C programming language.

Task 1: File Handling in C This task focuses on one of the most essential concepts in system-level programming: file handling. The program demonstrates how to:

1.Create a text file 2.Write data into it 3.Append more data without overwriting existing content 4.And finally, read and display the file content.

In the implemented C program (task1.c), standard library functions such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgets(), and fclose() are used. These functions allow interaction with the file system directly from within a C program. This task is crucial for understanding how data persistence works and how file I/O is managed in operating systems.
